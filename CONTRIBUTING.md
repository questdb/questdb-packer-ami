# Contributing to QuestDB

## Raise an Issue

Raising **[issues](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-packer-ami/issues)** is
welcome. We aim to respond quickly and thoughtfully. This is a good place to
start before deep diving into the code base.

# Committing

We use [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to
auto-generate release notes. We require all commit comments to conform. To that
end, commits have to be granular enough to be successfully described using this
method.

# Squashing commits

When submitting a pull request, we ask that you squash your commits before we
merge the changes.
